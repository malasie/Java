# Saper
### This Folder contains a code in jave for a simple Saper game.
The final program is supposed to:
- have five panels:
  * game board "plansza" - the left half
  * "boczny" (right side of the window) which is divided into three:
    - "Komendy" at the top, where all the masseges regarding the game will be shown
    - "sterowanie" in the middle containing:
      * text field "wielkość" to set the board size (4-10)
      * bottom "start" to start the game
      * and two bottons "cofnij" and "ponow" ("<<", ">>" ) which allows you to undo your move or redo it again
